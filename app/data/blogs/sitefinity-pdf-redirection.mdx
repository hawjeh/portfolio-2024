## 🚩 Introduction

When migrating to a new Sitefinity website, we encountered a need to **redirect legacy PDF links** from the old URL structure (e.g., `xxx.com/en/document/sample.pdf`) to their new locations.

By default, Sitefinity stores uploaded documents under the following URL pattern:

```/docs/<provider>/<library_folder>/<file and extension>```

Unfortunately, Sitefinity does not offer direct configuration options to modify this URL structure for Documents & Files.

We found no way to configure the Documents & Files setting.


## 🔍 Workaround Solution

After researching community discussions, we discovered a creative workaround using the **Pages module** to simulate the desired PDF redirection behavior.

Here's the step-by-step guide:

### 1. Update Allowed Page Extensions

Navigate to:

> **Sitefinity Backend ➔ Administration ➔ Settings ➔ Advanced ➔ Pages**

Under the Pages settings:

- Locate the **"Not allowed page extensions"** setting.
- **Remove `.pdf`** from the list to allow Sitefinity pages to have a `.pdf` extension.

This change enables the system to create pages that end with `.pdf`.


### 2. Upload the Document

Upload your PDF file to the **Documents & Files** module.

- **Note:** You will need the **"URL to file"** for later when setting up the redirect.

### 3. Set Up the Page Structure for Redirection

- Create the necessary page hierarchy to match the original URL path (e.g., `/en/document/`).
- Exclude intermediate pages (like `/en/` and `/document/`) from navigation if they are only meant for structuring.

Use the page settings to **hide from navigation**:

- Create a final page named `sample.pdf`.
- Since `.pdf` is now an allowed extension, the URL will properly end with `.pdf`.

For this `sample.pdf` page:

- Check **"Redirect to another page"**.
- Set the target to the document's URL obtained in Step 2 (you can use a relative path).

The structured approach categorizes and redirects documents cleanly.


### 4. Alternative: Root-Level Redirection

Alternatively, you can create a **single redirect page** at the root if matching the full path is challenging.

⚡ **Important:** Be aware of URL conflicts if the same path already exists as a structured page.

Example: `/en/documents/sample.pdf`

> Use `/documents/` instead of `/document/` if `/document/` is already taken.

### 5. Test the Redirection

Now, visiting:

- `xxx.com/en/document/sample.pdf`  
or  
- `xxx.com/en/documents/sample.pdf`

should correctly redirect to your uploaded PDF document!
