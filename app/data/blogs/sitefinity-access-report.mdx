## Purpose and Use Cases

The purpose is to create an Access Report of Sitefinity CMS - with multisite instances for client.

We know that administrator can set Permission in Sitefinity Page, either by role or user entity.

Each role has a group of user entity.

The challenge is that to query user and user within the role that has permission to pages across multi-sites.

Use cases to include in the report:

1. Page permission added user
2. Page permission added role
3. Application column to list full url of pages
4. Either create, delete, edit content or modify will consider as 'has permission'
5. Take only published and live page
6. Exclude backend page and omit redirect and group page.

## Solution

Checkout my sample gist code!

1. Loop through pages in multi-sites
2. Get the required pages
3. Query the operation / permission
4. The data queried is either user role id / user id
5. Gather users via user id and user role
6. Structure report in CSV format
