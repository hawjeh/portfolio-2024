## ⚙️ Pre-requisite

Before you begin, ensure you have installed the **Slow-Cheetah** NuGet package:

## 🚀 Here We Go: Step-by-Step Guide


### Step 1: Locate the Configuration Folder

In **Visual Studio**, navigate to the **App_Data** → **Sitefinity** → **Configuration** folder. 

> **Note:** If this folder is not already included in the Visual Studio project, make sure to add it.


### Step 2: Create a New Configuration File

Create a new configuration file that needs transformation. The file should follow the naming convention:

```
<ConfigName>.<Stage>.config (Ex. PagesConfig.Staging.config)
```


### Step 3: Set File Properties

Right-click the newly created file and select **Properties**. 

Set the **Build Action** to **Content**.


### Step 4: Install Slow-Cheetah

Ensure you have installed the **Slow-Cheetah** NuGet package in your project.


### Step 5: Add the Transformation File

Add a transformation file for the configuration. For example, `Authentication.Staging.config`.

### Step 6: Verify `.csproj` File

Check your **.csproj** file to make sure the root config (e.g., `AuthenticationConfig.config`) contains the following:

```
<TransformOnBuild>true</TransformOnBuild>
```

and the created AuthenticationConfig.Staging.config contains 

```
<DependentUpon>AuthenticationConfig.config</DependentUpon>
<IsTransformFile>True</IsTransformFile>
```

### Step 7: Publish with the Correct Build Configuration

Finally, publish the project with the appropriate build configuration (e.g., **Staging**, **Production**) to apply the transformation.
