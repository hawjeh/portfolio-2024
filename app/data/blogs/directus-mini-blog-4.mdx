<b>Setting up NextJS App</b>

<br/><br/>

### What's Next?

It’s pretty straight forward now.

We need to have a NextJS app, with directrus-sdk to communicate with Directus CMS and bootstrap for minor styling.


#### Installation

Run the spin up command

<code>npx create-next-app@latest</code>

```
√ What is your project named? ... frontend
√ Would you like to use TypeScript? ... Yes
√ Would you like to use ESLint? ... No
√ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? ... No
√ Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory? ... No
√ Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) ... Yes
√ Would you like to use Turbopack for next dev? ... No
√ Would you like to customize the import alias (@/* by default)? ... Yes
√ What import alias would you like configured? ... @/*
```


#### Check the Installation

Run the command to start the NextJS App

<code>npm run dev</code>

You should see this or similar message on screen. It is the default NextJS screen.

#### Clean the default setup

First thing we would like to do is removing the default code

```
fonts
globals.css
page.module.css
```

Clean up the tsx code

```
page.tsx
layout.tsx
```

Then add a .env file at root folder
```
.env
```

```
DIRECTUS_TOKEN=
DIRECTUS_PROTOCOL=http
DIRECTUS_HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0
DIRECTUS_PORT=8055
```

Put the token we got in previous steps at <b>DIRECTUS_TOKEN</b>
