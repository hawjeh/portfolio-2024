## Where to find the setting?

There is an option to update CSP rule in backend dashboard setting from Sitefinity v11 onwards, under
- /Sitefinity/Administration/Settings/Basic/WebSecurityBasicSettings

Please **avoid remove** the default CSP rule as it has high chance you will break Sitefinity frontend / backend unwillingly.

Example front-end broken:
