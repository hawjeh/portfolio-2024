## Where to Find the Setting?

Starting from **Sitefinity CMS version 11**, you can configure the **Content Security Policy (CSP)** rules directly in the backend dashboard:

- Navigate to:  
  `/Sitefinity/Administration/Settings/Basic/WebSecurityBasicSettings`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

**Do not remove the default CSP rules.**  
Altering or removing them without understanding their implications may unintentionally **break both the frontend and backend interfaces** of Sitefinity.
