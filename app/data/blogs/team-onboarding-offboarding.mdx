## Onboarding

<br/>

**Preface**

It is for developer to __reference, practice and enhance by chance__.

Assume all readers are __professional__ and understand the language.

The __guide__ here doesnâ€™t apply to all scenarios but I strongly believe __it does fit in somewhere__.

The list of children pages are __important__ to set a __baseline of common understanding__ with everyone.

We do believe __continuous improvement__.

Should you like to provide input and take chance to enhance it, ping the team lead anytime!

<br />
