🎉 Virtual Yusheng Tossing for Ox Year 2021 🧧🐂

A few weeks ago, I found out that the **Ox Year (2021)** celebrations were going to be very different — no mask-off moments, no group *louhei* shouts, and definitely no tossing *yusheng* shoulder-to-shoulder with friends and family, all thanks to the ongoing **COVID-19 pandemic**.

For many of us, this meant missing out on the festive chaos and shouting “**Huat Ah!**” at the top of our lungs while making a giant, delicious mess with our loved ones.

But then a thought hit me — *what if we could bring that experience online?*

Why not build a **virtual yusheng tossing app**, so we can still gather (digitally), celebrate, and toss for prosperity while following the rules and staying safe?

## 🎯 Turning the Idea into Reality

I pitched the idea to my boss, colleagues, and designers.

Their response?

> **"Go ahead with the idea!"**

So we got to work — and the result is a fun little site where anyone can enjoy the *Louhei* experience virtually.
