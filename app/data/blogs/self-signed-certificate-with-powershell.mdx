## How to Host a Local Application with HTTPS on a Windows PC or Server

In this guide, we'll show you how to set up HTTPS for a local application hosted on a Windows PC or Server. 

Using a self-signed SSL certificate, you can ensure secure communication for your local applications without the need for third-party certificates.

## Steps to Secure Your Local Application with HTTPS

### 1. Add a DNS Name to the Hosts File

To start, configure a DNS name for your local application by adding it to the hosts file located at:

`C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc`

### 2. Run Windows PowerShell as Administrator

Next, open **Windows PowerShell** as an Administrator. 

This ensures you have the required permissions to execute commands that affect system settings, such as generating a certificate.


### 3. Generate a Self-Signed SSL Certificate

In PowerShell, execute the following command to generate a self-signed SSL certificate for your local application:

```powershell
New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName "(dns_name)" -CertStoreLocation "cert:\LocalMachine\my" 
```

Replace (dns_name) with the DNS name you added in the hosts file (e.g., demo.local).

### 8. Open IIS Manager

To configure the website for HTTPS, open **IIS Manager** by pressing ```Windows + R``` and typing ```inetmgr```. Navigate to the website you want to secure.


### 9. Add an HTTPS Binding in IIS

In IIS Manager, open the Bindings section and add a new binding for HTTPS with the following settings:
- **Type:** HTTPS
- **IP Address:** (hosting ip address)
- **Port:** 443
- **Host Name:** Enter the DNS name (e.g., ```demo.local```).
- **SSL Certificate:** Select the self-signed certificate you created earlier.
- **Require Server Name Indication:** Check this option.


### 10. Test the Secure Connection

Finally, open your web browser and tadaaaa..! Connection is secure!
