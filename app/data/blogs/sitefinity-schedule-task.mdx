## Introduction

Scheduled tasks in **Sitefinity CMS** are components designed to execute predefined operations at a specific point in time.

They are typically used to run background processes, automate repetitive jobs, or schedule time-based logic without direct user interaction.

## Expected Workflow

The following diagram outlines the expected lifecycle of a scheduled task in Sitefinity:

![workflow](/assets/blogs/sitefinity-schedule-task/workflow.png)

1. A task is scheduled during application startup.
2. The `ExecuteTask()` method is triggered when the execution time is reached.
3. Within `ExecuteTask()`, the task reschedules itself via `ScheduleTask()`.
4. Steps 2â€“3 repeat at the defined interval.


## Schedule Task Code

There are two core methods involved:

- `ExecuteTask()` â†’ Executes when the current time matches the scheduled execution time.
- `ScheduleTask()` â†’ Schedules a new task for future execution.

### Execute Task

### Schedule Task

Below is the rewritten implementation:

#### Application Schedule Task Hook

```
#SampleTask.cs
 
public class SampleTask : ScheduledTask
{
    public SampleTask() { this.Key = "MyKey"; }
    public override string TaskName { get { return this.GetType().FullName; } }
 
    public override void ExecuteTask()
    {
        // Code to Execute Task
        ScheduleTask();
    }
 
    public static void ScheduleTask()
    {
        SchedulingManager schedulingManager = SchedulingManager.GetManager();
 
        var executeTime = DateTime.Now.AddMinutes(5);
        var existingTask = schedulingManager.GetTaskData().FirstOrDefault(x => x.Key == this.Key);
 
        if (existingTask == null)
        {
            // Create a new scheduled task
            SampleTask newTask = new SampleTask()
            {
                ExecuteTime = executeTime
            };
 
            schedulingManager.AddTask(newTask);
        }
 
        else
        {
            existingTask.ExecuteTime = executeTime;
        }
 
        SchedulingManager.RescheduleNextRun();
        schedulingManager.SaveChanges();
    }
}
```

#### Application Startup Hook

```
#Global.asax.cs
 
protected void Application_Start(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    Bootstrapper.Bootstrapped += Bootstrapper_Bootstrapped;
}
 
private void Bootstrapper_Bootstrapped(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    HousekeepingTask.ScheduleTask(init: true, rescheduleNewTask: false);
    InterfaceTask.ScheduleTask(init: true, rescheduleNewTask: false);
}
```

#### Schedule Task Table

**dbo.sf_scheduled_tasks**

<table className="table table-bordered">
    <thead>
      <tr>
          <th>Columns</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td>task_name</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>ky</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>is_running</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>execute_time</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>schedule_data</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>


### Conclusion

After placing breakpoints within the `ScheduleTask()` method, the following behavior was observed:


#### Execution Steps

1. The first call to `ScheduleTask()` finds `existingTask` as `null`.
2. `ExecuteTask()` is triggered when the scheduled time is reached.
3. Inside `ExecuteTask()`, `ScheduleTask()` is called againâ€”this time `existingTask` is *not* null.
4. A new execution time is assigned via `existingTask.ExecuteTime = executeTime`.
5. `RescheduleNextRun()` and `SaveChanges()` are called to persist the update.


#### Observations

- At step 3, the `is_running` flag on the current task record becomes `true`.
- Shortly after step 5, the database shows **two records**:
  - One with `is_running = true`
  - One with `is_running = false`
- Approximately 10 seconds later, the record with `is_running = true` is automatically removed.

This behavior helps clarify the meaning and lifecycle of each column in the scheduled task table.

<table className="table table-bordered">
    <thead>
      <tr>
          <th>Columns</th>
          <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td>task_name</td>
          <td>Name of class where implement the abstract class ScheduledTask</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>ky</td>
          <td>Task key</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>is_running</td>
          <td>True when task is running; False when task has yet to run</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>execute_time</td>
          <td>Task scheduled timing (next run)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>schedule_data</td>
          <td>To store cron task config (not applicable in this investigate)</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
