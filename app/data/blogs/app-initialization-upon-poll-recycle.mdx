# How to Initialize an IIS Application Before the First Visitor Request

This guide demonstrates how to configure IIS so that your application initializes automatically â€” even before the first visitor arrives. 

This helps reduce perceived cold start time by ensuring the app is already running.


## What We Want to Achieve

We aim to **spin up (initialize) the application earlier** than the first user request, improving the responsiveness of the site after a recycle or server reboot.

## Application Pool Configuration

### Advanced Settings

To keep the application running continuously:

- **Start Mode**: `AlwaysRunning`
- **Idle Time-out (minutes)**: `0`

This ensures the application pool remains active and does not shut down due to inactivity.

### Recycling Settings

- **Fixed Interval**: Set at **odd hours** (e.g., off-peak times) to avoid affecting user experience.

This schedules app pool recycling at specific intervals while minimizing impact.

## Website Configuration

### Advanced Settings

- **Preload Enabled**: `True`

This setting instructs IIS to proactively load the website when the server starts or the application pool recycles.

## Steps to Configure Application Initialization

### 1. Install the Application Initialization Feature

Ensure that the **Application Initialization** feature is installed on your Windows Server or development machine.

You can install it via **Server Manager > Add Roles and Features** or through PowerShell.

### 2. Open Configuration Editor in IIS

- In IIS Manager, navigate to your target website.
- Go to **Management > Configuration Editor**.

This is where the application initialization settings are configured.

### 3. Configure the `applicationInitialization` Section

Navigate to: ```system.webServer/applicationInitialization```

And apply the following settings:

- **Collection**: Add a new record
  - **hostName**: Your site domain (e.g., `demo.local`)
  - **initializationPage**: Path to the page to trigger app load (e.g., `/home`)
  - **doAppInitAfterRestart**: `True`
  - **remapManagedRequestsTo**: (Optional) Path to a static HTML file for placeholder response

This configuration ensures the application initializes after a restart, optionally showing a placeholder during warm-up.


## Summary

With the above settings in place, IIS will proactively load and initialize your application. 

This reduces the initial load time for users and creates a smoother experience, especially after app pool recycles or server restarts.
