## Important Notes

- Planning before execution
- Clearly understand each command / argument
- Must confirm input path are correct (no turn back if CD server erase all files)

## Strategy
![Strategy](/assets/blogs/sitefinity-tfs-cicd-part-2/strategy.png)

1/ Developer push code to TFS and it will send signal to CI server if it is a watching branch (in our case the branch is develop-int).

2/ CI server will carry on tasks, continue every next task when current task has no error. Finally, it will publish an artifact that is ready for CD server.

3/ CI server will trigger CD to start working and finally deploy the published artifacts if everything go smooth.

## My CI Pipeline Setting

Here we only make use of Tasks, Variables and Triggers.
We also skip VS Test as the sample is a dummy site.
