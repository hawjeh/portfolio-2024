# Handling DbContext Threading Issues in .NET Core with Entity Framework Core

While working on a **.NET Core** application using **Entity Framework Core** (EF Core) as ORM, 
we faced some threading issues due to multiple `DbContext` usage, JWT authentication, and API concurrency.

## üìà Request & Response Flow

```
Request ‚Üí 
JWT Middleware to grab user object ‚Üí 
Authorization Filter to stop multiple logins ‚Üí 
Touch Controller ‚Üí 
Repository ‚Üí 
Execute Query ‚Üí 
Response
```


## üõë Issue and Solution

### Common Exceptions

**1. Connection Closed Exception**

```
An exception occurred while **iterating over** the results of a query for context type. 
The connection is closed
```

- **Cause**: A queryable object was still in memory while a second query was attempted.
- **Solution**: Always ensure you materialize (e.g., `.ToList()`, `.FirstOrDefault()`) any queryable object before running another query.

**2. Parallel Operation Exception**

One or more errors occurred. (A second operation started on this context before a previous operation completed. This is usually caused by different threads using the same instance of DbContext.)

- **Cause**: EF Core does not allow multiple parallel operations on the same `DbContext`.
- **Solution**:
    - Always `await` asynchronous operations before making another database call.
    - Do not share the same `DbContext` across threads.


## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Tips

- ‚úÖ **Reduce API calls**: Consolidate similar frontend requests to minimize concurrent database usage.
- ‚úÖ **Await all async calls**: Ensure each query is awaited before proceeding.
- ‚úÖ **Register DbContext as Transient**:
```csharp
  services.AddDbContext<AppDbContext>(options => options.UseSqlServer(connectionString), ServiceLifetime.Transient);
```
- ‚úÖ Use IServiceScopeFactory: Create a fresh scope for parallel tasks if unavoidable.
