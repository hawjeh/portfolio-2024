## ‚òÅÔ∏è Introduction

Sitefinity Cloud allows users to manage their site configurations with Azure DevOps Variable Groups, offering flexibility and automation for deployment processes. 

This article will walk you through managing configuration settings, such as **site URL settings**, using Azure DevOps.


## üí° Here We Go: Step-by-Step Configuration Management


### Step 1: Get the Property Path

Start by retrieving the property path from your local machine.

### Step 2: Map the Property in WebConfig

Next, map the property in your **web.config** file (specifically, at line 81).

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <appSettings>
    ...
	 <add key="sf-env:systemConfig/siteUrlSettings:siteUrl" value="www.websparks.sg" />
    ...
  </appSettings>
</configuration>
```


### Step 3: Add Key-Value Pairs in Azure DevOps

Now, add the ***key-value pair*** variable through Azure DevOps to store the configuration securely.

### Step 4: Trigger Immediate Action

To apply the changes, rerun your ***CI/CD pipeline***.

**Specify the Build Configuration:**
- Staging ‚Äì For Staging environment.
- Production ‚Äì For Production environment.
- Release ‚Äì For both Production and Staging environments.


### Step 5: Disable Partial Deployment

Make sure to **uncheck** the **Partial Deployment** option to ensure a full deployment.

### Step 6: Specify the Stage to Run

Select the **stage** for which the configuration should apply.
