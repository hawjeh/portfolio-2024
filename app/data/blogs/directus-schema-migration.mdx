### Introduction

We explored schema migration tools to facilitate the exact replication of a Directus instance, ensuring a seamless transfer of its configuration and structure to another instance.

This approach accelerates the deployment and cloning of new projects, optimizing setup efficiency.

<br/>

### Process

First, we will need to have both the existing Directus instance and new target Directus instance running.

Both instances requried to be able to connect with token. 

In this migration case, we are using admin token for both.

Next, retrieve the current schema. The response is somewhat like this

```
{
  "version": int,
  "directus": string,
  "vendor": string,
  "collections": array<object>,
  "fields": array<object>,
  "relations": array<object>
}
```

This response will need to feed into the second request in order to check schema snapshot against target Directus instance.

The second response will get the schema differences.

Lastly, do schema apply from the differences to target Directus instance.

Sample code can be found [here](https://github.com/hawjeh/directus-schema-migration-tool).
