Since [AddThis](https://www.addthis.com/) announced its service termination by end of May, our team decided to search for an alternative social sharing tool.  
[ShareThis](https://sharethis.com/) emerged as a strong candidate due to its ease of use, customizable options, and stability.

### 7. Update Your Content Security Policy (CSP)

If your site uses a CSP, make sure to whitelist ShareThis domains:

<table className="table table-bordered">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <td>Directive</td>
        <td>Allow these domains</td>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>`script-src`</td>
        <td>`platform-api.sharethis.com`, `buttons-config.sharethis.com`</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>`connect-src`</td>
        <td>`l.sharethis.com`</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>`img-src`</td>
        <td>`platform-cdn.sharethis.com`</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
