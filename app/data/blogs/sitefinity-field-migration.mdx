# Sitefinity Field Migration: Fixing Postal Code Type from Number to ShortText

## Background Story

We had originally set up a content type in Sitefinity with `PostalCode` as a **Number** field. While this sounds fine at first, we later learned that:

- In coding/Sitefinity, a Number field is actually mapped to a `decimal` column in SQL.
- A decimal field cannot start with `0`, which makes it **unsuitable for Singapore postal codes**, as some begin with `0`.

This caused data entry issues. So, we needed to fix our mistake and allow valid postal codes, including those starting with `0`.

---

## Steps to Counter This Issue

1. **Backup existing content**  
   - Any schema change carries risk, so backup for disaster recovery.

2. **Create a new `ShortText` field called `PostalCodes`**  
   - `ShortText` maps to `nvarchar(255)` and supports leading zeros.

3. **Rename the old `PostalCode` field to `Postal Code (Old)`**  
   - To avoid confusion between the old and new fields.

4. **Run the field migration tool**  
   - See section below for how.

5. **Verify migrated data**

6. **Rearrange UI components** (dashboard, frontend, forms)  
   - For some reason, Sitefinity‚Äôs field arrangement may break on update.

7. **Delete old `PostalCode` field** once everything works.

## Migration Tool

![screen1](/assets/blogs/sitefinity-field-migration/screen-1.png)

We created a simple admin-only widget with:

- A text input (for method name)
- A submit button
- A message area for result feedback

We used **C# Reflection** to dynamically call migration methods from a generic utility class. Here‚Äôs what happens:

---

### Scenarios

**‚ùå Method name mismatch:**  
Returns:  
`‚Äú(method name) is an inappropriate method name.‚Äù`

**‚ö†Ô∏è Method exists, but new field not created:**  
Returns:  
`‚ÄúPlease setup the new field and run the migration tool again.‚Äù`

**‚úÖ Method exists and field is ready:**  
Returns:  
A list of migrated content items.

Just type in the method name, hit submit, and boom ‚Äî old postal codes are copied into the new field!

## Outcomes

- We learned and applied **Reflection** in real use case
- Created a **reusable tool** for other field migrations


## Further Enhancements

- Allow passing of content type, source field, and destination field via HTTP POST
- Generalize the migration logic to be fully dynamic
