Sitefinity v15.3 introduces two powerful AI-driven features to streamline your content management process:

1. **AI-Based Content Optimization**
2. **AI-Based Translator Integration**

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Pre-Requisites for Setup

Before diving into these features, ensure you have the following set up:

1. **Azure Subscription**
2. **Sitefinity 15.3**
3. **Install `Progress.Sitefinity.AIServiceConnector` NuGet Package**
4. **Install `Progress.Sitefinity.Translations.MicrosoftMachineTranslatorConnector` NuGet Package**

## üß† AI-Based Content Optimization

The **AI-Based Content Optimization** feature is designed to assist in content writing, offering suggestions and edits directly within the Sitefinity platform.


### How It Works

Once set up, you can now easily highlight text and ask for AI assistance directly. For example, you can request the AI to help in making the text shorter, clearer, or more engaging.

**Example:**

1. **Highlight the Text**  
   Simply select the text you want to optimize.

2. **Request AI Help**  
   Choose the desired optimization action, such as **"Make it shorter"**.

3. **Resulting Optimized Content**  
   The AI will process your request and generate a refined version of the content.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è AI-Based Translator Integration

### Setup for Translation

For seamless content translation, Sitefinity v15.3 integrates with **Azure Translator AI Service**.

1. **Azure Translator Service**  
   Start by setting up an Azure Translator service. Note that Azure offers a **free tier (F0)** for low-volume usage.

   ![Azure Translator](/assets/blogs/sitefinity-open-ai-azure/screen-5.png)

2. **Install the Translator Connector**  
   Install the **`Progress.Sitefinity.Translations.MicrosoftMachineTranslatorConnector`** NuGet package by following the steps outlined in the [documentation](https://www.progress.com/documentation/sitefinity-cms/microsoft-machine-translator-connector).

3. **Configure Sitefinity**  
   After installation, set the necessary parameters in the Sitefinity **advanced settings** screen.

### üìå Bug in Version 15.3.8500

There's a known bug in Sitefinity v15.3.8500 related to the Translator Connector. Please refer to my [bug report](https://community.progress.com/s/question/0D5Pb000025XPjnKAG/could-be-a-bug-in-microsoftmachinetranslatorconnector-sitefinity-v153).

**Fix**: Use the `SitefinityWebApp.CustomMicrosoftMachineTranslatorConnector` instead of `Progress.Sitefinity.Translations.MicrosoftMachineTranslatorConnector.MicrosoftMachineTranslatorConnector`.

## üîÑ Translating Content

Once the translator is configured:

1. **Set Your Site in Multilingual Mode**  
   Ensure your Sitefinity instance is set up in **multi-lingual mode**.

   ![Multilingual Mode](/assets/blogs/sitefinity-open-ai-azure/screen-7.png)

2. **Send Content for Translation**  
   From any content item or page, click on the **Action** dropdown and select **Send for Translate**.

   Choose the language to translate into and select the translation service you configured earlier.

### üì± Review and Publish Translated Content

After the content is translated, a **draft** version of the translated content is created for you to review before publishing.

![Translated Content Draft](/assets/blogs/sitefinity-open-ai-azure/screen-9.png)

You can also view the translation status by navigating to **/Sitefinity/Administration/Translations**.
