now you can highlight the text and ask for ai help directly
![screen2](/assets/blogs/sitefinity-open-ai-azure/screen-2.png)

e.g. make shorter

![screen3](/assets/blogs/sitefinity-open-ai-azure/screen-3.png)

You may refer to previous [blog](/blogs/sitefinity-open-ai) where we had discussed about the setup.

One thing to note while setting up the Azure Open AI service is to select the right model and specify the API version in Sitefinity setting screen.

You may refer to [here](https://www.progress.com/documentation/sitefinity-cms/integrate-ai-services#azure-openai-api-versions-and-ai-models)

Also, you may want to refer to this [KB](https://community.progress.com/s/article/unable-to-work-with-openai-plug-in) if you hit unknown error while using the ai service.

<br/>

## For AI-Based Translator Integration

First, setup a Azure Translator AI service.

There is a free F0 tier!

<br />

Second, follow the [step](https://www.progress.com/documentation/sitefinity-cms/microsoft-machine-translator-connector) to install nuget package to Sitefinity project

Next, sepcify the parameters in Sitefinity advanced setting screen.

<br />

Do not forget to enable the setting and specify the supported language after filling the parameters / leave it empty for all kind.

<br />

There is a bug in v15.3.8500, read here about my [report](https://community.progress.com/s/question/0D5Pb000025XPjnKAG/could-be-a-bug-in-microsoftmachinetranslatorconnector-sitefinity-v153)

Hence, the ConnectorType is SitefinityWebApp.CustomMicrosoftMachineTranslatorConnector instead of Progress.Sitefinity.Translations.MicrosoftMachineTranslatorConnector.MicrosoftMachineTranslatorConnector

Next, make sure the site is in multi-lingual mode

![screen7](/assets/blogs/sitefinity-open-ai-azure/screen-7.png)

<br />

Last, go to a content item / page, select Action -> Send for translate.

Select the language translate into, and select the translate service we defined.

<br />

Finally a draft translated version of content will be created.

You can now review the content before publish!

<br />

You can also access to the Translation Page ```/Sitefinity/Administration/Translations``` to see the translation status:
