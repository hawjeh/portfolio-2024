## ⚙️ Problem Statement

The published posts are not appearing in sitemap.

I have checked the "Show in sitemap setting" but it just do not showing up.

## 🧠 Solution

1. Ensure the "Show in sitemap" setting in the content type has checked and the content is published.

2. Ensure the related content type widget is deployed to a page.

3. Move the priority of the page (where the widget is placed) to top - pick where the detail page is located.

4. Regenerate the sitemap.

5. You shall see the articles showed in sitemap.
