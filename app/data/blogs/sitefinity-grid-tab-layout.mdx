# Overkill Tab Layout

This layout supports up to **7 tabs** in total. For a streamlined user experience, **tabs 4 through 7** are hidden by default using the Bootstrap utility class `d-none`.

This allows content editors to future-proof the layout with extra tabs while keeping the interface clean and manageable for end users.
