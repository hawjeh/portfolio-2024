# Git Code Packaging Tool (Electron App)

## üöÄ Purpose of the App

A lightweight utility to **quickly pull delta files based on Git commits** and package them into a **destination folder**. Great for developers working in environments requiring only changed files for deployment.

---

## ‚úÖ Pre-requisites

- Git is installed and added to your environment path
- You follow proper Git branching practices
- Your Git repository is clean and well-maintained (no junk files)


## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Run the application**

2. **Select folders**
    - **Destination Folder**: Where the delta files will be saved
    - **Repository Folder**: Path to the Git repository

3. **Branches auto-populate** when you select a repository

4. Click **Check Out** to see a list of Git commits from the current branch.

5. Click **Generate** to fetch delta files (changed files between selected commits) into your destination folder.

6. The app **remembers your last selection**, so it's quicker next time you open it.
