## üö© Introduction

In a recent project, we needed to **transcribe documents into HTML** format within Sitefinity, making them **editable directly via the Content Block** widget.

Sitefinity uses **Content Blocks** to manage rich text and HTML content. To extend its functionality and implement a custom document transcription feature, we needed to create a custom extension for the [Sitefinity AdminApp](https://github.com/Sitefinity/sitefinity-admin-app-extensions/).

---

## üí° Planning the Approach

After reviewing the available resources, we found a relevant [AdminApp Extension Sample Repository](https://github.com/Sitefinity/sitefinity-admin-app-extensions-samples).

The sample that closely matched our goal was the [Sitefinity Insert Videos Extension](https://github.com/Sitefinity/sitefinity-admin-app-extensions-samples/blob/master/editor-extender/sitefinity-videos/README.md).

While researching, we also discovered there are **paid products** available for document transcription. However, for flexibility and full control, we decided to build our own solution using [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://docs.aspose.com/words/net/).

Our plan was:

- Load the uploaded document in Sitefinity
- Transcribe it into HTML format using **Aspose.Words**
- Embed the resulting HTML into the Content Block editor

---

## ‚ö° Execution Strategy

Since the **AdminApp** is an **Angular application**, we needed an **API endpoint** that:

- Accepts a document ID
- Loads the document from Sitefinity
- Converts it to HTML

For the server-side API:

- We [loaded the document as a stream](https://docs.aspose.com/words/net/create-or-load-a-document/)
- [Converted the document to HTML](https://docs.aspose.com/words/net/convert-a-document-to-html-mhtml-or-epub/), configuring it to **export images as base64 strings** for embedded display

On the **AdminApp** side:

- We cloned the Insert Videos extension for structure
- However, we discovered that **there was no built-in method** for opening a Document Library picker, unlike the image or video selectors

---

## üîç Workaround for Document Selection

We utilized the **built-in `insertDocument` functionality** to allow document selection.

From our earlier research ([reference article](/blogs/sitefinity-adminapp-extensions-anchor-point)), 

we reused this method to access the Kendo Editor:


```
const editor = editorHost.getKendoEditor();
const editorValue = editor.value();
```

We applied a simple RegEx to extract the selected document'sID from the inserted link.

The API then:

- Retrieved the document using Sitefinity's **LibrariesManager API**
- Used **Aspose.Words** to transcribe the document into HTML
- Returned the resulting HTML to the AdminApp

Finally, we updated the Content Block editor:

```
editor.value(html);
editor.trigger('change');
```

This process enabled seamless insertion of transcribed, editable HTML content into the page!


## üì± Final Result

Here'show it looks once transcribed into editable HTML:

## üöÄ New Challenge: Base64 Images Not Displaying

After transcription, **images encoded in base64** were not displaying correctly in the Content Block.

We suspected Sitefinity's**HTML sanitizer** was stripping out the data URLs.

Upon further investigation, we realized the issue was with the allowed URL schemes.


## üí° Solution: Extending the HTML Sanitizer

We created a custom sanitizer by allowing the `data:` scheme:

```
public class SitefinityExtendedHtmlSanitizer : HtmlSanitizer
{
    public SitefinityExtendedHtmlSanitizer()
    {
        base.AllowedSchemes.Add("data");
    }
}
```

This resolved the issue, allowing base64 images to render correctly in the Content Block.


## üéØ Challenge Resolved!

Here's the working screen after base64 images are properly rendered:
