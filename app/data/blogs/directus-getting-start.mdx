### Pre-requisite

- Dockers, docker network and docker compose.
- Directus Headless CMS
- NPM command

<br/>

### Installation

For windows, you may consider to install docker desktop - it consists of docker and docker compose bundle.

For linux, install both docker and docker compose.

<br/>

### What are we building?

We are going to spin up Directus instance with PostgreSQL with docker compose yaml.

Sample yaml file:

```
name: demo
services:
  database:
    image: postgis/postgis:13-master
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: "demo_user"
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: "strong_password"
      POSTGRES_DB: "demo_db"
      PGPORT: 5432
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"

  directus:
    image: directus/directus:10.12.1
    ports:
      - "8055:8055"
    depends_on:
      database:
        condition: service_started
    environment:
      PUBLIC_URL: "instance_url"
      SECRET: "unique_secret"
      DB_CLIENT: "pg"
      DB_HOST: "database"
      DB_PORT: "5432"
      DB_DATABASE: "demo_db"
      DB_USER: "demo_user"
      DB_PASSWORD: "strong_password"
      ADMIN_EMAIL: "admin@admin.sg"
      ADMIN_PASSWORD: "strong_password"
```
<br/>

### Volumes

Volumes is optional, it can be local storage instead of storing it in docker image. Easier to migrate / move around. 
Example:

```
# postgresql db
volumes:
  - ./data/database:/var/lib/postgresql/data

# directus upload files
volumes:
  - ./uploads:/directus/uploads
```
<br/>

### Networks

In order to build virtual network within dockers so that the app can connect internally and easier to manage. 
Example:

```
# on each services
networks:
  - demo_net

# on root declaration
networks:
  demo_net:
    driver: bridge
```
<br/>

### Auto Restart

Specify this to auto restart the service when it goes down. Do always inspect logs to see what happen to the container service. 
Example:

```
# on each services
restart: unless-stopped
```
<br/>

### Pgadmin

You may also include PgAdmin - a free, open-source administration and development platform for PostgreSQL. 
It was mentioned here - [Getting Started with PsotgreSQL on Docker](https://www.sqlshack.com/getting-started-with-postgresql-on-docker/), 
all you needed to do is convert to YAML format so that docker-compose can pick it up.
Example:

```
# pgadmin
pgadmin:
  image: dpage/pgadmin4
  environment:
    PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: "admin@websparks.sg"
    PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: "strong_password"
    PGADMIN_CONFIG_SERVER_MODE: 'False'
  ports:
    - "5050:80"
```
<br/>

### Cache - Redis

Same to Pgadmin, make sure the right image and configuration are specified. References are at end of the content.
Example:

```
# cache
cache:
  image: redis:latest
  ports:
    - "6379:6379"
```

<br/>

### Demo Template

There are a few pre-built templates prepared by Directus that we can populate. 

First we need to retrieve access token from the administrator user -

![Screenshot1](/assets/blogs/directus-getting-start/screen1.png)

Then run the directus template cli command to generate auto populated template
```
npx directus-template-cli@latest apply
```
from [Github - directus-template-cli](https://github.com/directus-labs/directus-template-cli)

<br/>

After we execute the command - select

1/ Community templates
2/ Headless CMS - Website
3/ Input the Directus URL and Directus Admin Token
4/ Then it will auto populate templates to the site

<br/>

### Some useful commands

```
# Build and start the docker containers based on docker compose script
docker-compose up -d

# Shut down the containers
docker compose down

# List the network bridge
docker network ls

# Inspect and get information about the network / containers
docker inspect <name>

# Get logs of the service
docker logs <name>

```
