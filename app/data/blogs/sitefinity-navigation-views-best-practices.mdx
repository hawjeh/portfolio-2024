In our previous **NavigationView** implementation, we used `PageManager` to retrieve a full list of `PageNodes` in order to get page details and custom fields. 

However, this approach caused **performance hiccups**.  
After discussing the issue with Sitefinity Support experts, they recommended an enhanced solution.

## 💡 Recommended Approach

Instead of using `PageManager`, it is better to use the **`SiteMapBase`** class from the `Telerik.Sitefinity.Base` namespace.

### Why `SiteMapBase`?

- It **retrieves only the necessary page data**, avoiding redundant information.
- It **reduces database load** significantly compared to `PageManager`.
- It offers **faster and more scalable** navigation generation, especially for websites with a large number of pages.

The Sitefinity experts confirmed that using the **SiteMap API** is the **preferred method** for getting page nodes efficiently.
