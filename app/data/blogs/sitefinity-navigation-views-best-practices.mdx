Our previous NavigationView implementation was using PageManager to get a whole list of PageNodes in order to get the page details and custom fields.

It costed some performnace hiccup and after talking to Sitefiity Support expert, they suggested the code can be enhanced: A better approach for getting the page nodes would be using the <b>SiteMapBase class</b>, coming from the Telerik.Sitefinity.Base namespace.

The experts also confirmed that using the SiteMap API to get the page nodes would be the preferred way of implementing this behavior, as it causes a lighter load to the database in comparison to the Page Manager, which includes additional redundant data on each request.

Following code sample can be found in Snippets reference, the Navigation.cshtml is the snippet and NavigationView.Horizontal.cshtml is example code via OOTB NavigationView code.
