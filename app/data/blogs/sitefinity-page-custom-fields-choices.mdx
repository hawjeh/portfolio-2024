## Problem

The Custom Fields - Choices for Sitefinity page has only 1 choice of interface widget in v14.4 by default.

It will auto select Checkboxes. We can't easily select others like dropdown or radio button.

## Solution

You will need to go to Advanced setting to do so.

The path is 

```
ContentView -> Controls -> FrontendPages -> Views -> FrontendPagesCreate -> Sections -> CustomFieldSection -> Fields -> <field_name> -> RenderChoiceAs
```

And you will need to do it for FrontendPagesEdit to complete both setup.


## Finally

Go to Page -> (Select a Page) -> Title & properties, then you will see it is now Radio Button instead of Checkboxes!
