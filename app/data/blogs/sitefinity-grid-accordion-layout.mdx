# Overkill Accordion Layout

This layout implementation supports up to **7 accordion sections**. By default, **accordion sections 5 through 7** are hidden using the Bootstrap utility class `d-none`.

This approach ensures a cleaner interface on initial load while allowing flexibility for expanding content when needed.
