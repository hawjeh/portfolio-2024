# Git in a nutshell

Git is a powerful **distributed version control system (VCS)** that helps individuals and teams manage changes to code efficiently. 

Similar to tools like **Subversion (SVN)**, **Team Foundation Server (TFS)**, and **Mercurial**, 

Git allows you to keep track of changes, collaborate with others, and maintain a complete history of your project.

Git is a distributed version/source control system (VCS). Just like Subversion, Team Foundation Server, Mercurial; each has its pros and cons.


### Why Do We Need a Version Control System?

Version control is essential in any development environment—**from solo projects to large-scale applications**—because it allows:

- **Multiple developers to work simultaneously** without conflicts.
- **A complete version history**, so you can track and revert changes when needed.
- **Collaboration across teams**, even in different time zones.

# Understanding the Git Branching Model

Imagine Git as a giant tree, with many branches and millions of leaves. Each part of the tree has a specific role:

- **Root**: The stable, master version of your project.
- **Central Branch**: The main development branch.
- **Supporting Branches**: Feature, release, or hotfix branches that stem from the central branch.
- **Leaves**: Individual tasks or changes made by developers.
- **Energy**: Contributions that feed back into the project—aka, completed and reviewed tasks.

In Git, your **central repository** typically maintains two main branches throughout the project's lifecycle:
- `master` (or `main`): Your **production-ready** branch.
- `develop`: Your **staging** or main development branch.

# Git Branching Strategy

When managing a project with Git, here’s a rule of thumb that simplifies everything:

> 🧠 **One Task = One Branch**

This structure promotes cleaner code, easier collaboration, and better traceability. Here's a breakdown of common branch types:

- `master`  - Live production-ready code
- `develop` - Latest staging/testing code
- `feature/*` - New features or enhancements
- `release/*` - Preparing for deployment
- `hotfix/*` - Urgent fixes in production

To track project progress and releases, **tagging each release** (e.g., `v1.0.0`, `v2.0.1`) is highly recommended. 

This helps identify exactly what went live—and when.

# What is a Pull Request?

A **Pull Request (PR)** is a core Git workflow that allows developers to **submit their code for review** before it’s merged into the main branch. It’s an essential step for maintaining **code quality, readability, and team collaboration**.

Here’s how it typically works:
1. A developer creates a new branch and makes changes.
2. They submit a Pull Request for that branch.
3. One or more **reviewers** go through the code, provide feedback, and approve it.
4. Once approved, it’s merged into the target branch.

### Code Review Golden Rule

> 🔍 **Code should be clean, understandable, and maintainable—because no one wants to inherit messy code.**

# TL;DR – Git Best Practices in a Nutshell

There’s no “one-size-fits-all” Git strategy. The key is to choose a branching model that fits your **team size, workflow, and deployment cycle**. Here’s a simple flow to get started:

Whether you're working on a small project or a large-scale system, Git helps you **collaborate, experiment, and deploy with confidence**.
