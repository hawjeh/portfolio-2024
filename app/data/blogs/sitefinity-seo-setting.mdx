# Sitefinity SEO and Open Graph Configuration Guide

This guide walks you through configuring SEO and Open Graph metadata in **Sitefinity CMS** (tested on version **11.1**) to optimize your web content for both search engines and social media sharing.

---

## Enable Open Graph and SEO Properties

Navigate to:

**Settings â†’ Advanced â†’ System â†’ SEO and OpenGraph**

To allow Sitefinity to generate SEO and Open Graph tags:

- Ensure **SEO** is enabled
- Ensure **Open Graph Properties** are enabled

This step allows Sitefinity to inject meta tags for improved visibility in search results and on social platforms.

## Define Your Site Name

Navigate to:

**Settings â†’ Advanced â†’ Project â†’ DefaultSite**

Here, you can customize the **Site Name** that will be used in Open Graph metadata (e.g., `og:site_name`). This helps define brand identity when your pages are shared online.

## Configure Page-Level Settings

Before mapping Open Graph fields at the page level:

> âœ… **Pre-requisite**: Create a custom field named **OpenGraphImage** to represent the social sharing image.

Once created, you can assign this image on individual pages to customize the visual preview when shared on platforms like Facebook or LinkedIn.

            <th>Title</th>
