## üöÄ Why I Built This Module

While working on a project, I needed a simple way to export an **HTML table** to an **Excel** file using Node.js or JavaScript.

After searching, I realized:
- Most existing modules were **too complex**.
- Many were **over-engineered** for my needs.
- I just wanted something **lightweight**, **easy to use**, and **straightforward**.

So instead of forcing a complicated solution, I decided to **build my own**.


## üî• What It Does

**`@hawjeh/js-to-excel`** is a small JavaScript utility that makes it super easy to:

- Export an **HTML table** to a real Excel `.xlsx` file.
- Export **JSON data** to an Excel file.

It uses [exceljs](https://github.com/exceljs/exceljs) under the hood ‚Äî so it generates **actual** Excel files, not just CSVs pretending to be Excel!
