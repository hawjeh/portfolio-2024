Implementing centralized logging enhances transparency and governance across your CMS applications. This guide walks through setting up Azure Storage to capture Sitefinity CMS logs, using a clean hybrid implementation between .NET Core and MVC architectures.

The setup involves two main components:
- **Azure Storage configuration**
- **Custom code implementation in Sitefinity**

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Sitefinity CMS version 14.4 or later** (tested)
- **Hybrid Sitefinity project** (using both .NET Core Renderer and MVC with Progress.Sitefinity)
- **Azure Subscription** with appropriate permissions to manage Storage services

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Azure Setup

1. Log into the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and navigate to **Storage Accounts**.
2. Create a **new Storage Account** under your desired **Resource Group**.
3. Add a **Storage Table** to store logs, and save the **URL** for later use.

4. Generate a **Shared Access Signature (SAS)** for secure access to the Storage Table. You will need this for connecting Sitefinity to Azure Storage.

## üèóÔ∏è Sitefinity Setup

1. **Install NuGet Package**: In your Sitefinity project, install the `Azure.Data.Tables` NuGet package.

2. **Create Configuration Section**: Add a configuration section to store the **Azure Storage Table URL** and the **SAS connection string** (generated from Azure steps 3 and 4 above).

3. **Create Core Services**: Implement the following components in your Sitefinity CMS:
    - `Global.asax.cs` for application-wide settings
    - `UserService.cs` for user-related log processing
    - `AuditServices.cs` for storing audit-related logs

4. **Test the Log Implementation**: Perform a few login attempts to verify that logs are captured and stored in Azure Storage.

5. **Create Report View**: Develop a reporting view to display logs in the Sitefinity CMS dashboard:
    - `ReportController.cs` for handling the report generation
    - `ReportModel.cs` to structure the log data
    - `AuditReport.cshtml` for the report's front-end display

6. **Configure the Widget**: Add the custom widget to the **Backend Page** of Sitefinity for easy log viewing.
