## ðŸ’¡ Purpose and Use Cases

The goal of this project is to create an **Access Report** for Sitefinity CMS, specifically targeting environments with multiple sites.

In Sitefinity, administrators can assign permissions at the page level, either to a **specific user** or a **user role**.  
Each role, in turn, can have multiple users assigned.

**The challenge** lies in accurately querying and reporting both direct users and users within roles that have permissions across different multisite instances.

The report is designed to cover the following use cases:

1. **Page Permissions for Individual Users**  
2. **Page Permissions for User Roles**  
3. **Full Page URL in the Report**  
4. **Permission Types:**  
   - Create
   - Delete
   - Edit Content
   - Modify  
   *(Any of these operations count as having access)*  
5. **Only Include Published and Live Pages**  
6. **Exclude:**  
   - Backend pages
   - Redirect pages
   - Group pages

## ðŸ”¥ Solution Overview

A sample code has been prepared to address this challenge.

**The solution approach:**

1. **Loop through pages** across all multisite instances.
2. **Filter** only the required pages based on publication status and page type.
3. **Query page operations and permissions**, capturing both:
   - User IDs
   - User Role IDs
4. **Resolve users** associated with:
   - Direct permissions
   - Role-based permissions
5. **Structure the report** into a clean **CSV format** for easy review and export.
