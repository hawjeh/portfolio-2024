### What to expect on the local /publish folder?

It is building project with Publish mode

![table1](/assets/blogs/sitefinity-tfs-cicd-part-1/table1.png)

And yes, basically what we see on local /publish folder will be expected to deploy to destination server with CICD pipeline.

Part 2 will discuss further the CICD pipeline configuration
